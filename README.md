# Shopify-like Ecommerce Prototype

## Project Overview
This project is a prototype of an ecommerce web application inspired by Shopify's interface. It features a simple yet functional layout that allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and view their selections. The prototype showcases key elements of an ecommerce site, using modern web technologies and responsive design principles.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. There is no additional setup required.

## Usage
- Users can browse featured products displayed on the home page.
- Each product has an "Add to Cart" button, which allows users to add items to their shopping cart.
- The shopping cart is toggleable with a button on the navigation bar, enabling easy access to view selected items.
- Users can adjust the quantity of each item in the cart or remove items entirely.
- A total price is displayed at the bottom of the cart, and a "Checkout" button is provided (note: the checkout functionality is not implemented in this prototype).

## Features
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Search input for product filtering (not functional in the prototype).
- Interactive shopping cart sidebar that displays selected items and total price.
- Ability to add products to the cart and modify quantities directly within the cart view.
- Product data is dynamically rendered using JavaScript.
